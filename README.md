# Read-Duke
Record song play information from Duke FM with Python3.

In this project I will have my RaspberryPi recurringly read song title and artist information from the raidio staion's website. 
This information will be used to count how many times each song and artist is played.
Possible future applications could be weekly/monthly statistics or a streaming all time count.
This is my first data scraping project.
My beggining source of guidance is pythonprogramming.net.
